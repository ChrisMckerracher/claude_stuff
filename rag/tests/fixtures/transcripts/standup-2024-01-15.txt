[10:00] Alice: Good morning everyone, let's start the standup.
[10:01] Bob: Yesterday I worked on the auth-service JWT refresh endpoint. Today I'll finish the tests.
[10:02] Alice: Any blockers?
[10:03] Bob: No blockers, but I need a code review from someone familiar with the user-service integration.
[10:04] Charlie: I can review that. I worked on user-service last sprint.
[10:05] Charlie: Yesterday I fixed the payment-service timeout issue. Today I'm working on monitoring dashboards.
[10:06] Alice: Great. Dave, what about you?
[10:07] Dave: I'm still debugging the notification-service memory leak. It might take another day.
[10:08] Alice: Do you need any help?
[10:09] Dave: Not yet, but I might ping someone if I can't figure it out by EOD.
[10:10] Alice: Sounds good. I'm working on the deployment pipeline for the new gateway-service.
[10:11] Alice: Alright, that's it for today. Let's sync up again tomorrow.
