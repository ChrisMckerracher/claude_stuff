Meeting Transcript - Project Phoenix Standup
Date: March 15, 2024

[00:00:15] David Chen: Good morning everyone. Let's start with status updates.

[00:00:32] Jennifer Martinez: Hi David. I finished the API integration yesterday.
I emailed the results to jennifer.m@company.com and also CC'd the client at
bob.thompson@client-corp.org.

[00:01:15] David Chen: Great work, Jennifer. Did you get a chance to review the
security findings from last week?

[00:01:45] Michael O'Brien: I can speak to that. The penetration test revealed
some issues with the server at 192.168.1.100. We've already patched most of them.
Also, I noticed someone committed an AWS key - AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE - to the repo.
That's been rotated.

[00:02:30] Sarah Williams: Quick note - the patient records system needs review.
We found entries with SSNs like 987-65-4321 in the test database that should have
been scrubbed.

[00:03:00] David Chen: Thanks Sarah. Please coordinate with our compliance officer,
Dr. Amanda Foster, before the end of the week. Her direct line is (415) 555-0123.

[00:03:30] Jennifer Martinez: Will do. I'll also loop in the legal team at
legal-team@company.internal.corp.
