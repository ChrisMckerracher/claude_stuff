# /product

Invoke the Product Agent.

## Usage

`/product` - Validate current design against product expectations
`/product examine` - Analyze codebase from pure product lens (ignores code quality)

## What Happens

1. Product Agent activates
2. Reviews design or codebase from user-value perspective
3. Flags scope creep, validates problem-solution fit
4. Outputs validation report or product analysis
